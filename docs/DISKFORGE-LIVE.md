# DiskForge Live

A USB stick that starts any PC into a small desktop with DiskForge on it, plus a few other repair tools. I made it
for when the PC's own system won't start, when a drive is dying and you don't want to boot from it, or when it's
someone's Windows PC and you'd rather not install anything on it.

It opens on a home screen with big tiles for the usual jobs: drives and partitions, getting deleted files back,
TestDisk for lost partitions, and the USB stick tools. The everyday programs are under them (files, browser,
terminal, task manager, text editor), and a strip at the top says if Secure Boot is on, if there's internet and
how many drives it found. PhotoRec is in the start menu, and the boot menu has memtest86+.

The logo, colors, boot menu, boot animation, icons and themes were all made for it (`rescue/art/`,
`rescue/icons/`). The home screen is DiskForge itself (`diskforge --home`), and on a normal PC the same tiles
are in Tools → Quick Fixes.

It's the same DiskForge as the normal one, built from the same source for every release. The only things turned
off are the ones that change the running system (Mount at Startup, Disk Cleanup, Btrfs snapshots, the
schedules), since the stick starts fresh every time. They say so when you point at them.

It doesn't touch the PC unless you tell it to: it doesn't mount the PC's drives on its own, doesn't use its swap,
doesn't TRIM anything, and closing a laptop lid won't put it to sleep in the middle of a copy.

## Making the stick
In DiskForge: File → Make a DiskForge Live USB, then pick the ISO and the stick. It makes one FAT32 partition and
copies the ISO's files onto it, checking each one, so the stick still works as a normal stick everywhere (Windows
too) and the live system can save its logs on it.

It starts UEFI PCs (Secure Boot on or off) and old BIOS ones. For BIOS, DiskForge puts GRUB's boot code in front
of the partition like `grub-install` does (`boot/grub/i386-pc/stick-boot.img` and `stick-core.img` from the ISO).
That's a raw write to the stick, so on a normal PC it asks for your password. Untick "Also start old PCs without
UEFI" if you don't need it.

From inside DiskForge Live, Copy This Stick copies the stick it's running from onto another one. After "Copy to
memory" the stick isn't mounted anymore; mount it in DiskForge and the dialog finds it.

You can also write the ISO straight to a stick (Write Image to USB, Rufus, Etcher, dd). That starts UEFI and BIOS
PCs too, but it's read-only, so no logs.

## Secure Boot
It starts with Secure Boot on. The first steps are Debian's signed files as Debian ships them: shim (signed by
Microsoft), then GRUB and the kernel (signed by Debian). Everything after that is ours.

Two things don't work with Secure Boot on. memtest86+ isn't signed, so the menu tells you to turn Secure Boot off
for it. And Debian's signed GRUB won't load fonts, so the menu is plain text instead of the picture.

## Logs
Every start leaves a folder in `logs/` on the stick, named by date, time and the PC's model:

| File | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `summary.txt` | start here: the PC, UEFI or BIOS, Secure Boot on or off, graphics, network, drives, failed services, error count |
| `journal.txt` | everything the system logged since it started |
| `errors.txt` | just the warnings and errors |
| `kernel.txt` | the kernel's own messages |
| `hardware.txt` | dmidecode, lscpu, lspci, lsusb, UEFI boot entries |
| `disks.txt` | lsblk, blkid, smartctl for every drive |
| `udisks.txt` | what UDisks sees (what DiskForge works from) |
| `network.txt` | NetworkManager and addresses |
| `desktop.log`, `Xorg.0.log` | the desktop starting up, or why it didn't |
| `diskforge.log` | what DiskForge did (`--log`) |

They're saved a couple of minutes after starting, every 3 minutes after that, when shutting down, and when
you click Save Logs. The stick is only writable for the moment they're copied, so pulling it out at the
wrong time is unlikely to break it. The 30 newest are kept.

The logs have the PC's and the drives' serial numbers in them. Look before posting them somewhere public.

When the ISO runs as a CD (a VM's CD drive) it can't write to itself. Two ways around that:
- Plug in a stick made from the same ISO (in VMware: VM → Removable Devices → the stick → Connect). The
  logs go to that stick.
- Pick "Detailed messages" in the boot menu and give the VM a serial port that writes to a file: the
  kernel and the system log go there as they happen. In VMware: VM Settings → Add → Serial Port → Use
  output file.

## Building it
```
rescue/build.sh
```
It needs podman and about 10 GB free. No root: it all happens in a rootless container, nothing gets
installed on your PC. The first build downloads about 1.5 GB of Debian packages and keeps them in
`~/.cache/diskforge-live`. The ISO ends up in `rescue/out/`, about 900 MB.

`rescue/build.sh --no-app` reuses the DiskForge .deb from the last build, when only the rescue files changed.

What's where:

| | |
|---|---|
| `rescue/build.sh` | builds DiskForge's .deb, the builder container, then runs `make-image.sh` in it |
| `rescue/Containerfile` | the builder: Debian 13 with mmdebstrap, xorriso, GRUB, shim, memtest86+ |
| `rescue/make-image.sh` | makes the system with mmdebstrap, packs it with squashfs, puts the ISO together |
| `rescue/setup.sh` | runs inside the new system: the user, the window theme, services, the boot animation, the initrd |
| `rescue/packages.txt` | everything that goes in, with notes |
| `rescue/files/` | copied over the new system as-is (configs, the log saver, launchers, the taskbar and window themes) |
| `rescue/boot/` | the boot menu, its theme and its selection bar |
| `rescue/art/` | the logo, the colors, the boot menu and desktop pictures |
| `rescue/icons/` | DiskForge Live's icon theme, drawn for the stick (Breeze Dark fills in the rest) |
| `rescue/plymouth/` | the boot animation |
| `rescue/README.txt` | the README on the stick |

Each build gets its own ID. The stick, the initrd and GRUB all check it, so a second live stick in the same
PC can't get mixed up with this one.

## Testing it in a VM
QEMU with Secure Boot on, the way a normal PC has it (Microsoft's keys enrolled). Debian's `ovmf` package has
the firmware files (`OVMF_CODE_4M.secboot.fd` and `OVMF_VARS_4M.ms.fd`):
```
cp OVMF_VARS_4M.ms.fd vars.fd
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -cpu host -m 4096 -machine q35,smm=on \
  -global driver=cfi.pflash01,property=secure,value=on \
  -drive if=pflash,format=raw,unit=0,readonly=on,file=OVMF_CODE_4M.secboot.fd \
  -drive if=pflash,format=raw,unit=1,file=vars.fd \
  -cdrom rescue/out/diskforge-live-*.iso -serial file:serial.log
```
A stick made with Make a DiskForge Live USB can be tested the same way: make it on an image file (as a loop device,
see `rescueUsb()` in `tests/uitest.cpp`), then give QEMU
`-drive file=stick.img,format=raw,if=none,id=s -device qemu-xhci -device usb-storage,drive=s`.

In VMware: a new VM for "Other Linux 6.x kernel 64-bit", then VM Settings → Options → Advanced → Firmware type
UEFI, with Secure Boot ticked. Give it at least 2 GB of memory (4 is better) and the ISO as its CD.
